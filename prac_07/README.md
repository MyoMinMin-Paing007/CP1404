# Practical 07

## About this repository

This repository contains all practicals from week 1 to week 10
for [Cp-1404](https://github.com/ZawLattNaung/cp1404practicals).
I am a student from CP-1404 (Programming 2).My name is Zaw Latt Naung. I am currently learning IT at JCU.

## 3 Main Lessons I learnt about clean code

- Consistent Formatting**: Using proper indentation, spacing, and structure makes the code more readable and professional.
- Modular Design: Breaking down code into reusable functions and classes improves maintainability and testing.
- Code Comments and Docstrings: Writing helpful comments and docstrings explains the purpose of code blocks and helps others (and future me) understand the logic.
